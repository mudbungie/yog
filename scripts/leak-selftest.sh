# yog leak scan — the regression half, and the reason the gate cannot rot.
#
# SOURCED, never executed: `scripts/leak-scan.sh --self-test` sources this into
# its own shell, so the harness runs against the SAME `scan`/`scan_rule`/
# `scan_paths`/`scan_binary` the gate runs — a self-test that re-implemented the
# mechanism would prove only that the copy still works. It lives in its own file
# because the scanner is at the 300-line cap and "mechanism" and "the proof the
# mechanism still bites" are a real seam, not a shaved line (AGENTS.md).
#
# A leak gate does not die by being wrong; it dies by silently matching nothing
# after a pattern is edited, and then passing everything forever. So every rule
# owns a fixture (`scripts/leak-fixtures/<rule>.txt`) in which EVERY non-comment
# line must be flagged BY THAT RULE — line granularity, not file granularity, so
# one dead alternative inside a nine-way pattern cannot hide behind the eight
# that still work — and must carry `FIXTURE_MARKER`, because no regex can tell a
# real secret from a fabricated one and only the value can say so. The other
# direction is `clean.txt` / `clean-paths.txt`: near-misses that must NOT be
# flagged, because a gate that cries wolf on a fifth of the tree gets bypassed,
# and a bypassed gate is no gate.
#
# A `grep -q` HERE READS FROM A HERESTRING, NEVER FROM A PIPE (bl-e33a), and
# `scripts/beat-audit.sh` holds every tracked bash script in this repo to it. A
# `grep -q` on the receiving end of a pipe is a race, not a style: it exits the
# instant it matches and closes the read end, the writer is killed by SIGPIPE
# part-way through its own write, and `set -o pipefail` then takes the
# pipeline's status from that DEAD WRITER rather than from the reader that
# answered — so the pipeline reports FAILURE exactly when the pattern MATCHED.
# `PIPESTATUS` at a false answer reads `141 0`. Here that reported a live rule
# dead in one `make check` and passed on the next; the rates are measured at
# SHAPE C in `beat-audit.sh`, which is the guard and the one home for them.
# The ban is on the SHAPE rather than on the option, because a sourced
# file cannot see whether its caller set `pipefail` — this one does not set it
# and inherited it, which is how the defect reached the one file whose whole
# job is to prove the gate is not lying — and a herestring has no second
# process to die under either setting.

# Every non-blank, non-'#' line of a rule's fixture must be flagged BY THAT
# RULE and must carry FIXTURE_MARKER; nothing in the clean fixtures may be
# flagged by anything.
