# image scan — the disclosure gate for the OCI image, standing to `make image`
# exactly as `leak-scan.sh` stands to the commit.
#
#   scripts/image-scan.sh IMAGE        scan one built image
#   scripts/image-scan.sh --self-test IMAGE
#                                      plant fabricated secrets on top of that
#                                      image and prove each one is caught
#
# PORTED FROM THRALL (its bl-7075, itself a port of litany's bl-f963), under
# `docs/DESIGN.md` §10.1. The copy is deliberately close to byte-identical, and
# a short `diff` against either sibling is the only cheap defence against the
# three drifting apart. Every deliberate divergence is commented where it sits.
# §10.1 is explicit that each repo owns its own image tooling and that there is
# no shared build system — the components meet at the wire and nowhere else —
# so a copy is the shape, not an oversight.
#
# WHY THRALL'S COPY AND NOT LITANY'S. They differ in one functional line, the
# name of the engine variable, and in nothing else. thrall's `ENGINE` matches
# the `case`-table `leak-rules.sh` this repo already has; litany's
# `CONTAINER_ENGINE` rides beside a `declare -A` table yog does not use. One
# fewer difference between two files that must not drift.
#
# WHY A SECOND GATE AND NOT A REUSE OF THE FIRST. `make leak-scan` reads the
# git INDEX. An image is built from inputs no commit has: the build context as
# the engine actually receives it, the base image's layers, the package index,
# and the image CONFIG. Not one byte of that has ever been read by a gate, and
# a push is less recallable than a `cargo publish` — a tag can move, but the
# bytes anyone pulled are theirs. The condition on the registry ruling
# (`docs/DESIGN.md` §10.1) is that this runs before anything is pushed, wired
# into the build path rather than left beside it.
#
# THE STAKE HERE IS THE TRUST ROOT. yog's data root holds the wire's private
# CA and every leaf minted from it (REMOTE §1.4, §8), and the `Containerfile`
# says in as many words that none of it may reach a layer: an image that
# arrived carrying an identity would be the in-channel bootstrap REMOTE §1.4
# exists to forbid. Until this file, nothing checked that sentence.
#
# THE RULE TABLE IS THE SAME TABLE. `scripts/leak-rules.sh` says what counts as
# a leak and `scripts/leak-scan.sh` is the mechanism that applies it; this file
# adds neither. It decides WHAT TO HAND THEM, which is the whole of the problem
# an image poses. Two copies of the rules drift within a week.
#
# THREE TERMS, defined here because this file is the document that introduces
# them (they are packaging terms and name nothing on the wire, so DESIGN's
# module map and the protocol taxonomy are the wrong homes):
#
#   authored path      — a file or symlink in the built image that is not
#                        byte-for-byte what the pinned base image has at that
#                        path. Everything the build ADDED or REWROTE, and
#                        nothing it merely inherited.
#   distro floor       — the authored paths the package manager put there. The
#                        runtime layer runs `apk add`, which adds thousands of
#                        files this repo did not write; they are ACCOUNTED FOR
#                        (apk's own ownership ledger says which package owns
#                        each one) rather than exempted by path, because a path
#                        exemption is an allowlist and an allowlist is where a
#                        leak hides.
#   declared binary    — a binary this build authors on purpose. The set is
#                        DERIVED from the Containerfile's `COPY --from=`
#                        destinations, never typed here: the Containerfile is
#                        the one home for what crosses out of the build stage.
#
# HOW AUTHORED CONTENT IS ISOLATED, and why this way. Three mechanisms were
# available: diff the layer digests out of `podman save`, ask
# `podman image diff` for the answer, or export both rootfs and compare them
# here. This file does the third, for two reasons that are not style. It needs
# no JSON parser — `podman image diff --format json` and a save archive's
# manifest both do, and neither `jq` nor `python3` is a dependency of this repo
# — and `podman image diff` does not exist on docker at all, which would make
# the gate silently unavailable on exactly the engine the Makefile falls back
# to. Comparing exported filesystems uses only `create`/`export`, which both
# engines have. It is also the FINER answer: a layer-level diff calls a whole
# layer authored, while this calls a file authored only if its bytes differ
# from the base's at the same path.
#
# BASH 3.2, like every other script here. macOS ships it and always will, and
# `leak-rules.sh` is a `case` table rather than a `declare -A` map for exactly
# that reason — a gate that only runs on Linux is not the gate this repo's CI
# needs (`.github/workflows/macos.yml`). Nothing below uses an associative
# array, `mapfile`, or `readlink -f` outside the guarded idiom the other
# scripts already use.
#
# UNREADABLE IS REJECTED, NOT SKIPPED — the posture the source gate holds,
# carried over. The declared binaries are withheld from the table (their
# bytes are `cargo build`'s output over a source tree the source gate reads,
# and `grep -I` cannot read them anyway); ANY OTHER authored file the table
# cannot read reaches `leak-scan.sh`, whose `binary-content` rule refuses it.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS. `--self-test` layers a fabricated secret into a file AND
# into an `ENV` on top of the real image and requires the scan to catch each;
# the plain scan of the real image is the other direction. Every enumeration
# this file makes is checked for being non-empty, because a scan that
# enumerates nothing passes everything forever — the same discipline as the
# 300-line cap sweep and `leak-scan --self-test`.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT PROMISE. It scans one image, on the box that built it, before
# the push. It does not read what is already in the registry, it cannot
# un-publish a digest, and whoever runs the build can bypass it exactly as
# `--no-verify` bypasses the commit hook.
