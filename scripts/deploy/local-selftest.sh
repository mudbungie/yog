# The regression half of the native reconciler (bl-8ea9) — `make deploy-selftest`.
#
# **It drives the REAL `local-reconcile.sh`**, end to end, under a fake `curl`, a
# fake `cargo` and a fake `systemctl` on `PATH` and a scratch `HOME`. Nothing
# here re-implements the decision: a self-test that restated the rule would
# prove only that the copy still agrees with itself, which is the failure the
# leak gate's own self-test is written to avoid. Every assertion below is about
# what the shipped file did.
#
# It touches no machine and needs no network, no registry, no toolchain and no
# release, which is what lets it run in the gate — and that is the point. A
# reconciler is unattended code on somebody's box, so the failures that matter
# are the quiet ones: it stops installing, or it starts installing the wrong
# thing, or it stops restarting, and nobody finds out for a month.
#
# BOTH DIRECTIONS, and that is the shape of the table rather than a footnote.
# Half the cases assert an install or a restart HAPPENED and with exactly which
# arguments; the other half assert `cargo` was never invoked at all, or that the
# unit was never touched. A reconciler that installs on every tick, and one that
# has quietly stopped, are both broken and only one of them is loud.
#
# The pure decision is checked by the shipped script's own `--self-test`, run
# first below — the restart arms that need a live `/proc/<pid>/exe` cannot be
# reached from a fake world, and a table over the function is how they are
# proved. What the end-to-end cases add is that the facts fed to that function
# are read correctly off a box.
