## Why yog needs this (bl-61bf)

A workspace can be held from another box (REMOTE §8.2), and the sign-in is becoming an engine-side boundary act streamed to the seat (REMOTE §8.3). A device-capable row completes from ANY seat: the URL and user code stream to the seat, the human finishes in any browser (a phone's included), bz on the engine polls the token endpoint, and the credential lands in the engine's wall without ever crossing yog's wire. A browser-only row completes only where a browser can reach the engine's loopback. At the current pin the ONE builtin oauth2 row is browser-only, so a default install cannot be signed in from a remote seat without an operator port-forward.

## The facts, established at brazen 0.0.6 (the pinned crate)

- `data/defaults.toml` (embedded via `include_str!` in `src/config/load.rs`) ships exactly one oauth2 row, `openai-chatgpt`; its `[provider.oauth]` block declares `authorize_url`/`token_url`/`client_id`/`redirect` and NO `device_url`. Every other builtin row is api_key/bearer/none.
- brazen's device flow (`src/auth/flows.rs::device_flow`) is standard RFC 8628: form-POST `device_url` with `client_id`/`scope`, then poll `token_url` with `Grant::Device` until success/expiry.
- OpenAI's provider DOES serve a device flow for this exact client — but a CUSTOM one, not RFC 8628 (evidence: openai/codex, `codex-rs/login/src/device_code_auth.rs`): POST `{auth_base}/deviceauth/usercode` with `{client_id}` → `{device_auth_id, user_code, interval}`; poll `{auth_base}/deviceauth/token` with `{device_auth_id, user_code}`; success answers an `authorization_code` plus PKCE material, exchanged at the token endpoint as an ordinary AuthCode grant. The user-facing verification page is `auth.openai.com/codex/device`.
- Therefore declaring `device_url` on the row CANNOT work: brazen's RFC 8628 poll would be refused by that endpoint. The ask is a flow VARIANT, not a config line.

## The ask, two halves

1. **The Codex device-code variant, selected by row data.** Generic Rust keyed on a row-declared shape (e.g. `device = { url = "…", style = "codex" }` beside the RFC 8628 default), values as data on the builtin row — brazen's own severability stance: delete the block, delete the capability. One vendor caveat worth streaming verbatim when it fires: ChatGPT device-code login can be disabled in account/workspace security settings, and a disabled workspace refuses the flow at the provider — brazen's error stream is the surface.
2. **A device-capability column on `--list-providers` (json included).** The projected `Row` (`src/run/providers.rs`) gains the fact that the row can serve a headless flow (a bool, or the flow style). yog's flow rule (DESIGN §8.3 rule 1 as amended by bl-61bf) keys on brazen's own column, never a yog-side reclassification — the same discipline as the `auth` column.

## What yog does meanwhile

Unconditional `--browser` (behavior byte-for-byte unchanged), with the loopback port-forward remedy stated where the seat is remote (REMOTE §8.3). The yog-side consumer is the flow-rule ball in the bl-61bf chain; it bumps the pin (Cargo.toml is the pin authority) and branches the spawn on the new column.
